# Numberz
New home of the Numberz app and NumberzTest test app.

I sometimes use Numberz to inspire (or evaluate) test design skills. On the surface, it's simple. It's an app that generates 5 random munbers between 1 and 9 (inclusively), and then displays the sum of the five numbers.

The challenge is to determine whether the app is "correct" or not. 

The bugs are obvious if you look at the code, but finding the bugs without looking at the code requires test design techniques that look beyond the basic functionality of the application.
